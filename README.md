# One-Page
Simple one page made without frameworks. Had to do this school. The form at the bottom does store the data in a cookie. Clippy shows up when you hover over it. Website was not application enough so I need to build a game with in the website. So I did.

Made with HTML5 & CSS3 and Javascript.
