# One-Page
Simple one page made without frameworks. Had to do this for school. The form at the bottom does store the data in a cookie. Clippy shows up when you hover over it. Website was not application(like) enough so I need to build a game with in the website. So I created a tic tac toe game in javascript.

Created with HTML5 & CSS3 and Javascript.
